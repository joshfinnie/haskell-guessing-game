Some Haskell Guessing Games (They're terrible...)


### To run

- Download and install [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)
- Use `runhaskell` to run each guessing game:

```bash
$ runhaskell guessing_game_1.hs
```

or

```bash
$ runhaskell guessing_game_2.hs
```

## Please Note

This is not Haskell code you'd want to learn from yet... if it ever becomes that I will remove this message.
